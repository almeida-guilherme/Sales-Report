# Sales-Report
An automation built with UiPath that extracts data from a PDF, converts the currency using an API, uses OCR to read a CAPTCHA, and fills out a sales report. In the end, it generates the report as a PDF and sends a final summary to the user. This robot was developed using the REFramework.
